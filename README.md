# Energy-Consumption_Tableau
The dataset that we have been provided is of the energy consumption according to various parameters like Department type, usage count days, from date, to date, Supply cost, Demand cost. Here we have the energy type to be Water, Natural gas, Electric, steam and Oil from which the Water, Natural gas and Electric is considered and plot is been generated.
When we consider the department type, we have many departments but filtering it out by considering just the significant and most effective departments I considered BPS,PWD and PARK which are having some better values for visualization.
The Business question that I decided to answer was:
1.	What is the total consumption according to different energy type?
2.	What is the usage period according to different Energy Type?
3.	What is the departmentwise monthly consumption of every department considering each Energy Type?
4.  Lastly what is the supply and its respective delivery cost in each year?

The Dashboard contains a pitcure of all the sheets together in an interactive manner where the values changes according to the month and itâ€™s the combination of the all the workbooks put down together by giving the title as Energy Consumption.
